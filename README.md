**Kiro** is a customizable Arch Linux ISO builder based on the ArcoLinux project. It provides a simple way to build your own Arch-based installation medium with your choice of packages, settings, and scripts.

Kiro is my personal choice:

- systemboot
- ext4
- sddm
- xfce4 and chadwm
- a lot of free software

## Features

- Fully customizable build process
- Based on official Arch Linux tools and methodology
- GUI from https://github.com/calamares/calamares
- Script-driven: reproducible and automatable
- Modular structure for easy extension
- Lightweight and minimal by default
